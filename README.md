# Project Description
This game is built using **MonoGame** and follows the **Model-View-Presenter (MVP)** design pattern.

MonoGame is a versatile framework for creating cross-platform games, providing robust tools and libraries for game development. By implementing the MVP pattern, we've separated the game's logic, user interface, and data handling, resulting in a more manageable and scalable codebase.

The MVP pattern divides the application into three interconnected components:

***Model***: Manages the data and business logic. <br>
***View***: Handles the display and user interaction. <br>
***Presenter***: Acts as an intermediary, processing input from the View and updating the Model. <br>

This architecture enhances code maintainability, testability, and flexibility.


## Technologies used:
1) Random walk algorithm to generate the main route
2) skid steering [magic formula] to simulate tank control
3) QuadTree to optimize collision handling
4) Gilbert Johnson Keerthi Algorithm (GJK) for definition of collisions
5) StateMashine for logic of Underground Launcher <br>
